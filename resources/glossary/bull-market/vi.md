term: BULL MARKET

---
A prolonged period during which the price of an asset, such as bitcoin, rises relative to a fiat currency, typically the US dollar. Since its introduction in 2009, the BTC bull market cycles appear to be influenced by halvings, scheduled events that halve the miners' reward and occur approximately every four years.
