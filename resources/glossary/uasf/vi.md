term: UASF

---
Acronym for "*User-Activated Soft Fork*". Describes a soft fork in Bitcoin when it is initiated and enforced by the network's users through their nodes, without relying on miner approval. The network nodes update their software to adopt the new rules of the soft fork, and let the chips fall where they may!

Typically used in emergency situations, especially when miners are largely opposed to the adoption of a soft fork, the UASF serves as a means of pressure to prevent an excessive concentration of power among miners. In practice, the UASF has even become a tool of deterrence, brandished by node operators when miners abuse their power. However, if the UASF is actually implemented, it carries risks, including the possibility of a blockchain split, creating a new chain that may lack economic value and security. The first formal proposal of a UASF came from developer Shaolin Fry, who pushed BIP148 in March 2017 to pressure miners who were refusing to signal for SegWit.
