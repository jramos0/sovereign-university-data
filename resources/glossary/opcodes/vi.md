term: OPCODES

---
A set of commands used in the Bitcoin script system. Script is a stack-based programming language used to establish spending conditions, and thus, indirectly secure bitcoins. The instructions used in script language are called "opcodes". These are logical operators and commands for manipulating stacks. These specific instructions are executed by the network nodes when adding a transaction to the blockchain. Script is a non-Turing complete language. It can be categorized as an intermediate-level language (almost low-level) inspired by Forth.

> ► *"Opcode" can be translated into French as "code opératoire". In practice, the term "opcode" is directly used in common language.*
