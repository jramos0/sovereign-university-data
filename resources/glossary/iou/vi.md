An acronym for _I Owe You_, used in the context of Bitcoin to refer to digital assets that are backed by underlying assets to which they should normally be indexed. This term is particularly applicable to stablecoins or representations of BTC on systems external to Bitcoin, such as sidechains, drivechains, exchange platforms, or ETFs. These digital assets represent a promise of value equivalent to that of the underlying asset.
