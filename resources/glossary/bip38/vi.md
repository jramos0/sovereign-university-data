term: BIP38

---
A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that introduces an encryption mechanism to add extra protection to private keys through a passphrase. BIP38 ensures that even if a third party physically obtains the encrypted private key, they cannot use it without knowing its passphrase. This adds an additional layer of security to protect bitcoins from theft, especially for the security of old paper wallets.

> â–º *Although this proposal is referred to as a "passphrase," it is important not to confuse it with the passphrase mentioned in BIP39, which is much more commonly used. However, the underlying concept remains similar: while BIP38 aims to secure an individual private key, BIP39 provides protection for an entire HD wallet.*
