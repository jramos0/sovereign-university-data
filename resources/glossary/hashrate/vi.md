term: HASHRATE

---
Indicator of the computing power of the network, measured in hashes per second (H/s). It indicates the miners' capacity to perform hashing operations as part of the proof of work. A high hashrate means greater security for the economic history of Bitcoin and increased resistance to attacks, as a significant amount of computing power would be required to compromise the network.

The hashrate is also indicative of the competition among miners: the higher the hashrate, the greater the mining difficulty, which influences the distribution of rewards, and thus the profitability of miners. It is therefore a key indicator of the health and security of the Bitcoin system. Just as the hashrate is used to measure the overall computing power of the Bitcoin network, it can also be used to measure the computing power of a machine, a mining farm, or a mining pool.

> â–º *In French, it is referred to as "taux de hachage," although the term "hashrate" is widely used in everyday language.*
