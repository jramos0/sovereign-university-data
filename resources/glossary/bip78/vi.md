term: BIP78

Introduces a protocol for using Payjoin on Bitcoin, a transaction structure that enhances payment confidentiality by involving the recipient in the inputs alongside the payer. This BIP is inspired by BIP79, which had already presented a similar concept. However, these two BIPs do not mark the origin of the Payjoin concept. Indeed, the Stowaway implementation by Samourai Wallet already existed beforehand, and this transaction structure was first mentioned by LaurentMT in 2015, under the name of “*steganographic transaction*”.
