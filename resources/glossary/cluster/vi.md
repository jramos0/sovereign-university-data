term: CLUSTER

---
In the context of chain analysis, a cluster is a set of receiving addresses that are associated with the same entity by an analyst. By using various heuristics, it is possible to detect on-chain activities that appear to emanate from a single person or organization. This grouping of activities forms what is called a cluster. The goal of chain analysis is often to identify an entry point into this cluster, thereby linking all these activities to a form of real-world identity.
