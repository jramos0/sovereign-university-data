term: SATOSHI (SAT)

The satoshi, often abbreviated as "sat," is the smallest subdivision of bitcoin that can be recorded on the blockchain. It is named in honor of the inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. A single Bitcoin is divided into 100,000,000 sats, meaning that one satoshi is equivalent to 0.00000001 bitcoin. Due to its small unit value, the sat is frequently used for pricing, especially in small transactions. Its use is often preferred over BTC on the Lightning Network.
