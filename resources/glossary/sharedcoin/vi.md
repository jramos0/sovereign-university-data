term: SHAREDCOIN

Bitcoin mixing service launched in 2013 by Blockchain.info, but is no longer in operation today. This service offered users a way to enhance their privacy on Bitcoin by combining their transactions with those of other people, using a mixing technique similar to coinjoins. SharedCoin provided a form of privacy without the need to trust the coordinator, as users' coins remained under their control throughout the process. Unlike centralized mixing services of the time, bitcoins could not be stolen by the intermediary. SharedCoin subsequently faced issues leading to the deanonymization of some of their mixes in the early summer of 2014.
