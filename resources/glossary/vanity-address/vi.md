term: VANITY (ADDRESS)

---
A custom receiving address that contains a specific sequence of characters chosen by the user, usually for aesthetic reasons. These addresses are generated by executing a calculation process, where multiple private keys are created until one of them matches a receiving address containing the desired sequence. This process does not compromise the security of the address but can require significant time and computational resources, especially for longer or more specific sequences. It is a kind of brute force process.

> ► *In French, it is referred to as an "adresse personnalisée."*
