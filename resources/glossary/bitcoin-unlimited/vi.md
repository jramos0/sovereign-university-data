term: BITCOIN UNLIMITED

---
A proposal to update the Bitcoin protocol that emerged in late summer 2016, aiming to increase block size flexibly via a hard fork. This fork was supported by the big blockers during the Blocksize War, notably by Roger Ver. Unlike Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited did not set an upper limit on block size, but allowed users to define their own parameters. These parameters included the maximum generation size, the additional block size, and the acceptance depth. However, Bitcoin Unlimited was criticized for its technical complexity and security vulnerabilities. This update was ultimately never adopted.
