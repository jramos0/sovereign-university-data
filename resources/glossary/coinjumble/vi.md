term: COINJUMBLE

---
Software developed by Chris Belcher and launched in August 2014 designed to facilitate the use of coinjoins with a GUI. Unlike other coinjoin implementations of the time that required participants to want to perform a coinjoin simultaneously, CoinJumble allowed for the sharing of transaction parts asynchronously. Users could exchange via external communication channels to share the encoded transaction parts. Today, CoinJumble is no longer in use.
