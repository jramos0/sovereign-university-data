term: BITCOIN QT

---
Bitcoin QT is a Bitcoin client that includes a graphical interface, released in May 2011. It follows in the footsteps of the client created by Satoshi himself. In 2014, Bitcoin QT was renamed "Bitcoin Core". It is now the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It has been packaged with `bitcoind` since version 0.5. Moreover, even today, the graphical interface of Bitcoin Core is called `bitcoin-qt` in reference to the software's origins.

> â–º *The "QT" comes from the name of the library used for the graphical interface. The name "QT" is sometimes interpreted as a play on words on the sound of the term "cute".*
