term: DOS (DENIAL OF SERVICE)

---
A cyber attack aimed at making a resource (website, node, online service...) unavailable to its legitimate users. Attackers overload the target with an excessively high volume of data or requests, which depletes the system and network resources of the victim, leading to slowdowns or a complete halt. DoS methods can vary, but the goal remains the same: to prevent access to services or data. In the specific context of Bitcoin, a DoS attack may aim to saturate the network or nodes with an excessive volume of requests in order to hinder their normal operation. The goal is often to harm a node operator or the network's availability for honest users.
