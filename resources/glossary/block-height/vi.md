term: BLOCK HEIGHT

---
Refers to the sequence number of a particular block in relation to the first block, known as the "Genesis Block," which is indexed at height zero. This indicator tells us the number of blocks that precede the block in question. For example, if a block is at height 650,000, it means there are 650,000 blocks that precede it. Block height is used to identify a specific block within the blockchain. Contrary to popular belief, block height does not determine which chain is valid, as nodes synchronize on the chain that has accumulated the most work, not necessarily the longest chain.
