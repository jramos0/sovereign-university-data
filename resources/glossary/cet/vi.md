term: CET

---
Acronym for "*Contract Execution Transaction*". It is a specific transaction within a DLC that facilitates the final settlement between parties based on the outcome of a future event. When the oracle publishes a signature corresponding to the event's result, the parties use this signature to complete and unlock the CET, which sends the funds to the winning party. The signed CET is then mined, and the winner receives the bitcoins they are owed according to the smart contract's terms. All other potential CETs, which would have been executed in the case of different outcomes, become obsolete and are abandoned.
