Harold T. Finney II, known as Hal Finney, was a cryptographer and developer famous for his crucial role in the early days of Bitcoin and his contributions to cryptography. From the publication of the Bitcoin White Paper in 2008, he was one of the first to interact with Satoshi Nakamoto. He provided feedback, reported bugs, and suggested improvements after the software's launch in January 2009. He was the recipient of the first Bitcoin transaction (outside of coinbases), receiving 10 BTC from Satoshi in block number 170:

Hal Finney is also likely the first person, after Satoshi, to have mined a block: block number 78. More than that, Hal Finney was the first promoter of Bitcoin during a period when the project was still unknown.

Beyond Bitcoin, he is also recognized for his invention of RPoW (*Reusable Proofs of Work*), an electronic currency system launched in 2004. Although RPoW did not achieve the expected success, it remains one of the most accomplished precursors to Bitcoin. As a committed cypherpunk, Hal Finney also played a crucial role in the development and improvement of PGP (*Pretty Good Privacy*). Hal Finney passed away on August 28, 2014, due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). He was cryogenically preserved by the Alcor Foundation. He remains a major figure in the history of cryptography and Bitcoin.
