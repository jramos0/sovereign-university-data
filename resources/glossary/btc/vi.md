term: BTC

---
Stock or currency symbol (*ticker*) used to represent a unit of bitcoin on exchange platforms. It is used to quickly identify bitcoin among other assets and currencies. One unit of bitcoin (1 BTC) is equal to 100,000,000 satoshis (or "sats").

> â–º *"BTC" is the historical symbol for bitcoin, but it does not comply with the ISO 4217 standard, which governs currency codes. According to this standard, "BT" is assigned to Bhutan and currencies not backed by a state, such as bitcoin, should start with an "X". This is why some organizations use the symbol "XBT" for bitcoin. Although "XBT" is not yet officially recognized by the ISO 4217 standard, it nevertheless meets its criteria.*
