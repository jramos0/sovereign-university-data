term: WALLET

---
A software tool specifically designed to secure and manage a user's private keys. If the wallet is stored and managed on a software device itself installed on a versatile machine, it is referred to as a "hot wallet". Conversely, if it is stored in software, itself installed on a dedicated hardware device solely for this task and not connected to the internet, it is then referred to as a "cold wallet". The wallet notably allows the use of private keys to sign transactions, thereby fulfilling the conditions for spending bitcoins.
