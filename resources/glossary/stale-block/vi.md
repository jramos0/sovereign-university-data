term: STALE (BLOCK)

---
Refers to a block without children: a valid block, but excluded from the main Bitcoin chain. It occurs when two miners find a valid block at the same chain height within a short period of time and broadcast it over the network. Nodes eventually choose a single block to include in the chain, based on the principle of the chain with the most accumulated work, rendering the other "orphaned," "obsolete," or "stale."
