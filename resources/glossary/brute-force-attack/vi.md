term: BRUTE FORCE (ATTACK)

---
A cryptanalysis method for finding a password or key that involves trying every possible combination of keys or passwords through trial and error until finding the one that grants access to a privilege or protected information. This technique relies on intensive computation and can be extremely time-consuming, especially against large keys. To counter this type of attack, it is necessary to use longer password and key sequences to increase the number of operations required for the attacker. In theory, the complexity of such an attack is exponential in relation to the length of the target.
