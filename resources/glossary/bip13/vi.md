term: BIP13

---
Introduces a standardized method for creating P2SH addresses. BIP13 specifies the P2SH address format, which starts with the prefix `3`, and includes the hash of a script rather than the hash of a public key. This type of address will remain the preferred standard for multisig wallets for a long time.
