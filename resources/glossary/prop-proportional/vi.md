term: PROP (PROPORTIONAL)

---
Method of calculating the remuneration of miners within the context of mining pools. PROP simply distributes the block reward among the miners proportionally to their contribution in shares. The calculation of shares starts at the last block found by the pool and ends when a new block is found. Each new block resets the share counter to zero. This remuneration method allows for the direct reflection of each participant's work.
