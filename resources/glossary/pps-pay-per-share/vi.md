term: PPS (PAY PER SHARE)

---
Method for calculating the remuneration of miners within the context of mining pools. PPS is a system where miners are paid for each valid share submitted, regardless of whether the pool finds a block or not. They are therefore compensated based on the expected value. It is a task-based remuneration method.

Each submitted share is considered a contribution to the mining process and has a predetermined fixed value. This method offers stable and predictable compensation for miners, as it eliminates the variance associated with the probability of finding a block. However, it is riskier for pool operators, as they must pay the miners even when no block is found, thus absorbing the variance risk. Unlike the FPPS method, PPS does not include transaction fees in the compensation calculation.
