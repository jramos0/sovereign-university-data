term: NEW YORK AGREEMENT (NYA)

---
A private meeting held in 2017, bringing together more than 50 companies from the Bitcoin ecosystem, following the Consensus 2017 conference. The goal of this meeting was to end the long-standing debate on scaling Bitcoin by reaching an agreement. This meeting led to the proposal of SegWit2x, drawing inspiration from the previous SegWit2Mb proposal. It planned two major modifications to the Bitcoin protocol:


- The adoption of SegWit with an activation threshold set at 80 percent of signaling;
- A hard fork aimed at increasing the maximum block size from 1 MB to 2 MB.

Despite over 80% of miners signaling in favor, the project failed to achieve sufficient consensus, leading to its abandonment. This event was interpreted by many users and developers as an attempted attack on Bitcoin.
