term: DRIVECHAIN

---
A specific form of sidechain where the miners of the main blockchain (Bitcoin) play a direct role in the governance of the two-way peg and potentially in the consensus mechanism of the sidechain. This protocol was invented by Paul Sztorc and could be implemented through the controversial BIP300, which would allow for a two-way peg with the miners, and BIP301, which would enable optimal use of merged mining.
