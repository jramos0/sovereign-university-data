term: LABEL

---
Label or annotation assigned to a UTXO in a Bitcoin wallet to remember its origin. For example, if I own a UTXO coming from a P2P purchase on Bisq with Charles, I could assign it the label `Non-KYC Bisq Charles`. This is a good practice that helps to remember the origin or intended destination of that UTXO, which facilitates fund management and privacy optimization. Labeling becomes even more important when used with coin control. Indeed, by allowing users to differentiate and precisely select UTXOs for their transactions, this practice helps to avoid merging UTXOs from different sources. This limits the risks associated with the Common Input Ownership Heuristic (CIOH), which can reveal the common ownership of the inputs of a transaction.
