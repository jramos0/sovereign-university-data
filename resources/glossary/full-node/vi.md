term: FULL NODE

---
A full node, or "Full Node" in English, refers to a computer that runs a Bitcoin protocol client, and downloads, verifies, and stores the entire blockchain, which is the complete history of transactions since the Genesis block. A full node autonomously verifies all transactions and blocks according to Bitcoin's consensus rules. Therefore, this type of node provides the highest level of verification for its user, and minimizes the need to trust a third party. A full node requires more storage resources, computational power, RAM, and bandwidth than a light node (SPV).
