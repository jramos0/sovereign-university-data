Acronym for "*Transparent Index Of Distinct Extended Shares*". It is a method for calculating miner compensation within mining pools introduced by the Ocean pool in 2023. This method distributes rewards based on a weighted percentage of the work dedicated to the most recently found shares. Each proof is compensated multiple times, with a reward calculation that includes transaction fees. This system ensures high precision in miner payments, without the need for a custodial intermediary to process payments, unlike other methods such as FPPS. TIDES is designed for transparent remunerations.
