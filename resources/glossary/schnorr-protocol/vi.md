term: SCHNORR (PROTOCOL)

---
The Schnorr protocol is an electronic signature algorithm based on elliptical curve cryptography (ECC). It is used in Bitcoin to derive a public key from a private key and to sign a transaction with a private key. In Bitcoin, just like ECDSA, Schnorr is based on the use of the elliptical curve `secp256k1`, characterized by the equation: $y^2 = x^3 + 7$. The Schnorr signature protocol has been implemented in the Bitcoin protocol since November 2021 with the activation of the Taproot update.
