term: B-MONEY

---
Prototype of a decentralized cryptocurrency designed by Wei Dai in 1998. This system envisioned a network where participants would be identified only by public keys, and where each transaction would be signed by the sender. B-money was established on an account-based model rather than a UTXO model, as is the case with Bitcoin today. It allowed for the creation of money through a type of proof of work linked to a basket of goods. Thus, it was a precursor to the current principle of stablecoin. This concept was never implemented.
