term: 51 PERCENT ATTACK

---
A hypothetical scenario in the Bitcoin system where a malicious actor controls more than 50% of the total computational power for mining (hashrate). With such dominance, the attacker can manipulate the consensus process, allowing for malicious actions such as double spending, where the same bitcoins are spent once on a chain that is eventually rendered obsolete, and then a second time on the valid chain. Another outcome of a 51% attack is the censorship of transactions. However, carrying out a 51% attack requires considerable financial, human, energy, and technical resources, and makes the malicious actor susceptible to being discovered before the attack can occur. Although theoretically possible, a 51% attack on Bitcoin is considered highly unlikely due to the decentralization of mining and the significant computational power currently deployed.
