term: DDOS

---
A form of DOS where the attack comes from multiple sources simultaneously, making defense more complex. Attackers often use networks of computers infected with viruses (botnets) to launch massive requests towards a single target. This strategy amplifies the effectiveness of the attack by overloading the targeted system's capacities in order to cause service interruptions.

> â–º *In English, it can be translated as "Distributed Denial of Service attack".*
