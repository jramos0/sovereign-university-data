term: PARTITION RESISTANCE

---
The ability of the Bitcoin network to remain unified and maintain consensus among users by keeping connections and preventing the separation of certain nodes from the rest of the network, despite attempts to fragment it. For a node to remain in consensus with the network, it must maintain at least one active connection with a set of peers that share the same consensus rules.
