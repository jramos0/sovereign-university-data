term: DUST

---
Refers to extremely small amounts of bitcoin that are too minor to be sent in a transaction, as the transaction fees required to include them in a block would be proportionally higher than their value. The precise definition of "dust" can vary depending on the context, but it generally refers to any transaction output that requires more in fees to spend than it is worth. For Bitcoin users, it is important to manage their UTXOs and practice consolidating them so they do not become dust.

> ► *In French, this could be referred to as "poussière."*
