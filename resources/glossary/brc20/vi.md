term: BRC-20

---
A standard enabling interaction with non-native tokens on Bitcoin, based on the Ordinals protocol inscriptions. Created by Domo in March 2023, this experimental standard has sparked significant speculative interest, leading to a historic increase in transaction fees in April and May 2023. BRC-20 tokens use Bitcoin to store and timestamp JSON functions managing these assets. The functions are `deploy` (token creation), `mint` (token issuance), and `transfer` (token transfer). To execute this protocol, individuals must maintain servers that catalog all the functions. The BRC-20 standard is thus a highly inefficient use of Bitcoin compared to other token creation protocols such as RGB.
