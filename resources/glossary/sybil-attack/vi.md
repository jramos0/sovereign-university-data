term: SYBIL ATTACK

---
A cyber attack in which an individual or entity creates multiple false identities in a system to exert undue influence or gain an unauthorized advantage. In the context of Bitcoin, such an attack aims to obtain undue influence over the system, thereby manipulating the consensus mechanisms. To counter Sybil attacks, Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned a proof of work system that imposes a non-negligible marginal cost on the creation of multiple votes.
