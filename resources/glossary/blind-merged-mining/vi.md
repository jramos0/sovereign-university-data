term: BLIND MERGED MINING

---
A consensus technique for sidechains that allows Bitcoin miners to work simultaneously on the main chain and on one or more sidechains, without having to provide additional computational work. Unlike traditional merged mining, this method does not require setting up a new node for each exploited sidechain. In the context of Blind Merged Mining (BMM), each sidechain is managed by independent node operators, responsible for creating blocks and collecting the associated rewards on the sidechain. In return, these operators must purchase proof-of-work from the main blockchain miners to validate their blocks on the sidechain. Thus, Bitcoin miners receive their merged mining rewards from the sidechains in BTC, directly on the main chain. This method, developed by Paul Sztorc for drivechains, requires the implementation of BIP301 to be operational on the Bitcoin network.
