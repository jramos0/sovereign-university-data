term: MINING FARM

---
A facility where numerous mining machines (often ASICs) are grouped together to mine bitcoin by participating in the proof of work process. The purpose of this grouping is to facilitate the management of the machine park and to achieve economies of scale, especially in terms of setup, maintenance, cooling, electricity supply, and network connection. The mining farm also aims to improve the proximity of miners, thereby reducing latency that could affect their profitability.
