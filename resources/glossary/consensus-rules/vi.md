term: CONSENSUS RULES

---
Fundamental rules in Bitcoin, ensuring the network's integrity by dictating the validation criteria for transactions and blocks. A transaction that does not follow the consensus rules cannot be mined into a valid block. For example, a transaction that includes an invalid signature for one of its inputs could not be included in a block. Thus, we differentiate between consensus rules and standardization rules.
