term: SEGWIT2X

---
A controversial attempt at a hard fork aimed at doubling the block size limit on Bitcoin, while integrating SegWit. SegWit2x was introduced during the New York Agreement in 2017, a confidential meeting among over 50 companies from the ecosystem that aimed to find a solution for scaling the system. SegWit2x sought to increase Bitcoin's transactional capacity by raising the maximum block size to 2 MB, from the initial 1 MB. The hard fork was scheduled at block 494,784, which was during November 2017.

Despite the implementation of SegWit in August 2017, the 2X project to double the size did not succeed in achieving consensus, notably because of the opposition campaign "NO2X", leading to its cancellation at the beginning of November. This episode was perceived by many users and developers as an attack against Bitcoin, in the context of the Blocksize War.
