term: LIGHTNING NODE

---
A computer that runs an implementation of the Lightning Network (Eclair, LND, C-Lightning...). A Lightning node is established on a Bitcoin node and enables the creation and management of bidirectional payment channels between different users. Lightning nodes are interconnected, forming a network of payment channels. These channels allow for an almost unlimited number of transactions without the need to individually publish them on the Bitcoin blockchain.
