term: PPLNS (PAY PER LAST N SHARES)

---
Method for calculating the remuneration of miners within the context of mining pools. PPLNS rewards miners based on their contribution of shares over a given period. In PPLNS, payments are made only when the pool finds a block and are determined by the number of shares submitted by the miner relative to the total shares collected during the observed period. This method favors consistent and active miners over the long term, as it discourages pool hopping (frequent changing of pools). The remuneration varies with the probability of finding a block, which can lead to a decrease in the miner's income consistency (more variance than pay-per-share).
