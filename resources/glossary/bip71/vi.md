Defines a MIME (*Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions*) media type, in accordance with the RFC 2046 standard, for bitcoin payment request messages in BIP70. MIME is an Internet standard that extends the format of electronic messages to allow the sending of various types of data in a structured manner. In BIP71, the adoption of a specific MIME type for payment messages ensures that wallet software, when sending payment protocol messages via email or HTTP, adheres to Internet standards for proper encapsulation of messages. Since this enhancement was bundled with BIP70, it was never widely adopted.
