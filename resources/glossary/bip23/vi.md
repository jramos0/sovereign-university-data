term: BIP23

---
This BIP is an extension of BIP22, aiming to encourage its adoption by the software used by mining pools, especially by the Getwork protocol, the predecessor of Stratum. Proposed by Luke Dashjr, this extension seeks to integrate the BIP22 standard into Getwork by default, in order to facilitate its adoption by mining pools. The main goal of BIP23 is to transmit the entire block template to miners, thereby allowing them to audit and possibly modify the structure of the block proposed by the pool. This approach aims to mitigate concerns related to the centralization of mining, by giving individual miners greater control and better transparency over the block creation process.
