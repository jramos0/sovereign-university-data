term: COINSHUFFLE

---
Bitcoin mixing protocol proposed in 2014 by Tim Ruffing, Pedro Moreno-Sanchez, and Aniket Kate, inspired by the idea formalized by Gregory Maxwell. Coinshuffle allows for the disconnection of coin history without requiring a trusted third party. The protocol ensures that even the intermediary cannot link the payer to the payee. This concept has never been widely adopted, with privacy techniques such as Chaumian coinjoin being preferred.
