term: POT (PAY ON TARGET)

---
Method of calculating the remuneration of miners in the context of mining pools. POT is a compensation system that varies according to the difficulty of the work sent to the pool rather than the difficulty of the work provided by the pool. In this approach, the reward for each share submitted by a miner is established based on the difficulty of that specific share. This means that more difficult shares are rewarded better than less difficult ones. It is a variant method of PPS, but by adjusting the reward based on the actual complexity of the work done, POT involves much more variance for the miner.
