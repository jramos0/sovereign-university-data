term: CHAIN ANALYSIS

---
Practice that encompasses all methods used to trace the flow of bitcoins on the blockchain. Generally, chain analysis relies on the observation of characteristics in samples of previous transactions. It then involves identifying these same characteristics in a transaction that one wishes to analyze, and deducing plausible interpretations. This problem-solving method, based on a practical approach to find a sufficiently good solution, is known as a heuristic. To simplify, chain analysis is done in two main steps:


- Identifying known characteristics;
- Deducting hypotheses.

One of the goals of chain analysis is to group various activities on Bitcoin in order to determine the uniqueness of the user who performed them. Subsequently, it will be possible to attempt to link this bundle of activities to a real identity through an entry point. It is important to understand that chain analysis is not an exact science. It relies on heuristics derived from previous observations or logical interpretations. These rules allow for fairly reliable results, but never with absolute precision. In other words, chain analysis always involves a dimension of likelihood in the conclusions drawn. For example, it may be estimated with more or less certainty that two addresses belong to the same entity, but total certainty will always be out of reach. The whole objective of chain analysis lies precisely in the aggregation of various heuristics in order to minimize the risk of error. It is, in a way, an accumulation of evidence that allows us to get closer to reality. These famous heuristics can be grouped into different categories:


- Transaction patterns (or transaction models);
- Heuristics internal to the transaction;
- Heuristics external to the transaction.

It is noteworthy that the first two heuristics on Bitcoin were formulated by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. He presents them in part 10 of the White Paper. It is interesting to observe that these two heuristics still maintain a preeminence in chain analysis today. These are the Common Input Ownership Heuristic (CIOH) and address reuse.
