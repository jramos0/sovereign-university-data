term: TRANSACTION MODEL

---
A transaction pattern is simply a model or an overall structure of a typical transaction that can be found on the blockchain, and whose likely interpretation will be useful in the context of a chain analysis. When studying patterns, we focus on a single transaction that we analyze at a high level (as opposed to the internal and external heuristics of chain analysis). In other words, we will only look at the number of UTXOs in inputs and the number of UTXOs in outputs, without dwelling on the more specific details or the environment of the transaction. From the observed model, we will be able to interpret the nature of the transaction. We will then look for characteristics about its structure and deduce a likely interpretation.
