term: ASIC

---
An ASIC is an electronic component designed to perform a specific function with optimal efficiency. In the context of Bitcoin mining, ASICs are specialized integrated circuits that perform high-speed, low-energy hash operations. They specialize in executing the `SHA256` hash function used in the proof-of-work mechanism. Initially, ASIC refers to the name of the chip. By extension, the acronym "ASIC" often also refers to the machine that houses this chip. Thus, specialized computers in Bitcoin mining are sometimes called "ASICs," or "miners." ASICs have gradually replaced other mining methods, such as using processors (CPU) and graphics cards (GPU), due to their superior energy efficiency and much higher hash rate.

> *The acronym "ASIC" stands for "Application-Specific Integrated Circuit." In French, this term can be translated as "Circuit intégré spécifique à une application".*
