term: PROOF-OF-KEY DAY

---
An annual initiative observed every January 3rd (the anniversary of the Genesis block) that encourages Bitcoin holders to simultaneously withdraw all their assets from exchange platforms and transfer them to self-custody solutions. The goal is to test the solvency of exchange platforms by forcing them to prove that they indeed hold the Bitcoins of their users and that they are not engaging in fractional reserve banking.
