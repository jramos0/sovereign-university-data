term: INBOUND PEER

---
A node in the Bitcoin network that initiates a connection to your node without your intervention. Bitcoin Core allows a maximum of 125 inbound peers by default, to facilitate connectivity within the network. Inbound peers are approached with caution, as one cannot be sure of their honesty, given that these connections are initiated by third parties. Inbound and outbound peers share the same type of information. The main difference between inbound and outbound peers lies not in the type of information exchanged, but in how these connections are established.

> ► *The English translation of « pair entrant » is "inbound peer" or "incoming connection".*
