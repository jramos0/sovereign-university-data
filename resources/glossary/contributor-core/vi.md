term: CONTRIBUTOR (CORE)

---
A contributor in the context of Bitcoin Core (the majority implementation of nodes on the Bitcoin network) is a person who actively participates in the development of the software by writing code, reviewing, and testing the changes proposed by others. Unlike maintainers, contributors do not have the power to merge changes into the main code; their role is rather to submit pull requests (PR) and to participate in the discussion and validation of these proposals. Any interested individual can become a contributor without the need for a nomination or formal approval, which differs from maintainers who are charged with higher administrative and decision-making responsibilities in the project.
