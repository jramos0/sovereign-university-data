term: POOL HOPPING

---
Refers to the practice of some miners who frequently switch mining pools to maximize their earnings. These miners move from one pool to another based on fluctuations in profitability. This strategy exploits differences in the reward calculation methods of the pools. Pool hopping can unbalance the distribution of rewards within the pools and is generally considered an unfair practice in the community.
