term: BLOCK SUBSIDY

---
The amount of new units that can be created by the miner who solves a block. This subsidy is part of the block reward along with transaction fees. It is distributed within a specific transaction called "coinbase". Initially set at 50 bitcoins per block in 2009, this subsidy is halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years) through a process known as "halving". When the subsidy falls below the amount of 1 sat, it can no longer be collected, and the block reward will rely solely on transaction fees. Unless there is a protocol change, the circulating money supply can then no longer be increased.
