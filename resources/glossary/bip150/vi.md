term: BIP150

---
Proposes an authentication mechanism between peers on the Bitcoin network to enhance security and ensure the ownership of nodes. It allows node operators to restrict access to certain services or grant data flow priorities only to specific peers, by mutually authenticating to avoid MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) attacks. This BIP will remain in draft status, but it will serve as a lesson for BIP324 (*P2P transport V2*), which is now optionally implemented in Bitcoin Core.
