term: BLOCK REWARD

---
The total bitcoins received by a miner when they find a valid block on Bitcoin. This reward consists of two elements: the block subsidy and the transaction fees. The block subsidy is a fixed amount of bitcoins that the miner can create out of nothing. This amount decreases gradually over time through events known as halvings. The transaction fees are the cumulative fees paid by users to carry out the transactions included in the mined block. The fees are also bitcoins created by the miner, but their amount is limited to the amount of bitcoins destroyed in the transactions. Indeed, the fees of a transaction represent the difference between the total inputs and the total outputs.

The block reward is distributed within a specific transaction called "coinbase". The bitcoins extracted from it are automatically locked for a period of 100 blocks. This is referred to as the maturity period.
