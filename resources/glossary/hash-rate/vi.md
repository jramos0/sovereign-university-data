term: HASH RATE

---
Indicator of the computing power of the network, measured in hashes per second (H/s). It indicates the miners' capacity to perform hashing operations as part of the proof of work. A high hash rate means greater security for Bitcoin's economic history and increased resistance to attacks, as a substantial amount of computing power would be required to compromise the system.

The hash rate also indicates the competition among miners: the higher the hash rate, the greater the mining difficulty, which influences the distribution of rewards and the profitability of miners. It is therefore a key indicator of the health and security of the Bitcoin system. Just as the hash rate is used to measure the overall computing power of the Bitcoin network, it can also be used to measure the computing power of a machine, a mining farm, or a mining pool.
