term: MAINTAINER (CORE)

---
In the context of the Bitcoin Core project, the predominant implementation of nodes on the Bitcoin network, maintainers are individuals tasked with managing the project. They bear the responsibility for its implementation. They are in charge of moderation on the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository and of setting the schedule for the release of new versions. They are primarily responsible for conducting the merging of pull requests (PR) proposed by contributors.

In other words, when a code modification proposal has passed through the various stages of validation, it is these maintainers who assume the significant responsibility of merging the new code with the Bitcoin Core software. Before proceeding with this merge, maintainers check if the code adheres to the fundamental principles of the project, if it has reached the minimum standards required to be included, and they also judge the general consensus of the contributors about this modification. As of writing this definition, only five maintainers remain on Bitcoin Core: Hennadii Stepanov, Michael Ford, Ava Chow, Gloria Zhao, and Ryan Ofsky.
