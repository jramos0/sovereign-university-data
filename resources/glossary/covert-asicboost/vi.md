term: COVERT ASICBOOST

---
The secret version of AsicBoost. AsicBoost is an algorithmic optimization method for Bitcoin mining. In its Covert version, miners manipulate the Merkle tree rather than the Nonce, thereby reducing the calculations needed for each SHA256 hash by keeping some data unchanged between hashing attempts. Unlike the Overt version of AsicBoost, the Covert version conceals the use of AsicBoost during the mining process. However, since the introduction of SegWit and its second Merkle tree, this method has become less effective, as the number of calculations required for its use has become too large compared to a traditional mining process.
