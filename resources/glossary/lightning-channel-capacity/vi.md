term: LIGHTNING CHANNEL CAPACITY

---
The amount of bitcoins locked in a multisignature address that represents a payment channel on the Lightning Network. The capacity of a channel is thus the maximum amount of sats (satoshis) that can be transmitted through this specific channel. It is defined at the time of the channel's creation by the sum of the funds that a party commits to the channel. The "inbound capacity" refers to the maximum amount of bitcoins that a node can receive through a channel. The "outbound capacity" represents the maximum amount of bitcoins that a node can send across a specific channel.
