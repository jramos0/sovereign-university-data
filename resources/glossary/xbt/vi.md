term: XBT

---
Stock and currency symbol (*ticker*) used to represent bitcoin, in accordance with the ISO 4217 standard that governs currency codes. Unlike "BTC," which is the historical symbol, "XBT" follows the convention that currencies not backed by a state start with an "X". Thus, although not officially recognized by the ISO, "XBT" is used by some organizations to represent units of bitcoin.
