term: FUNGIBILITY

---
The property of a currency that ensures each unit is interchangeable and indistinguishable from another similar unit. Bitcoin, as a unit of account, is in principle fungible, because one bitcoin is always worth another bitcoin: 1 BTC = 1 BTC. However, the traceability of UTXOs (the support for the units) on the blockchain can sometimes compromise this fungibility. Indeed, each satoshi can be distinguished by its history, which gives it a specific identity. The perception of the history of each UTXO can influence the judgment of the parties on the fungibility of the bitcoins used. Thus, although fungibility is an intrinsic characteristic of monetary units, it can be altered by the specifics of the medium used for these units, as is the case with Bitcoin.
