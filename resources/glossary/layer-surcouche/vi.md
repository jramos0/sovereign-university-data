term: LAYER (SURCOUCHE)

---
A "layer" (or "surcouche" in French) is a protocol or network built on top of, by stacking over, the main Bitcoin network. It uses the Bitcoin network as a foundation and is thus dependent on its protocol. However, the Bitcoin network is not dependent on its layers. An example of such a layer is the Lightning Network.

These layers are designed to extend the capabilities of the Bitcoin network by adding additional functionalities or capabilities, such as faster transactions, tokens, or micropayments. They are often created to address certain limitations of the Bitcoin network, while benefiting from its security and decentralization. It is important to note that although these layers are built on the Bitcoin network, they have their own distinct protocols and mechanisms separate from those of the Bitcoin network itself.
