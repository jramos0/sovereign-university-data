term: GREEN ADDRESSES

---
An old Bitcoin address proposal where transactions sent to it are pre-approved by a trusted third party. This concept allows parties receiving funds through this address to consider them as immediately trustworthy, without waiting for inclusion in a block. It relies on the trust placed in the service controlling the green address, as it guarantees that the funds sent have not been and will not be double-spent. This type of service was once used to speed up transactions (zero-conf), but it is no longer in use today.
