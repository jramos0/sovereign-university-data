term: BIRTH DATE (WALLET)

---
Refers to the date on which a wallet was created. This information is important when restoring a wallet, as it allows the software to know from which block it should start searching for transactions associated with that wallet. By knowing the birth date, the software can efficiently synchronize and retrieve the transaction history without having to analyze the entire blockchain from the Genesis block.
