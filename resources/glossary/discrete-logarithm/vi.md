term: DISCRETE LOGARITHM

---
The discrete logarithm is a mathematical problem that is used in some public key cryptographic algorithms. In a cyclic group of order $q$, with a generator $g$, if one has an equation of the form $g^x = h$, then $x$ is called the discrete logarithm of $h$ with respect to the base $g$, modulo $q$. In simple terms, it involves determining the exponent $x$ when $g$, $h$, and $q$ are known. The discrete logarithm is thus the inverse of the exponential in a finite cyclic group. However, for large values of $q$, solving the discrete logarithm problem is considered algorithmically difficult. This property is exploited to ensure the security of many cryptographic protocols, such as the Diffie-Hellman protocol for key exchange.

The discrete logarithm is also used in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), including in the ECDSA (*Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm*). In the context of elliptic curves, the discrete logarithm problem extends to finding a scalar $k$ such that $k \cdot G = K$, where $G$ and $K$ are points on the curve, and $\cdot$ represents the point multiplication operation. In the context of Bitcoin, scripts can use either ECDSA or the Schnorr protocol to lock UTXOs. Both rely on the infeasibility of calculating the discrete logarithm.
