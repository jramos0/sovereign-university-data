A Bitcoin improvement proposal introducing a new format for messages that convey addresses of nodes accepting incoming connections. This proposal allows for the support of larger address sizes, particularly to facilitate the integration of future network protocols and more complex IP addresses such as TorV3 or I2P. This improvement is also known as `addrv2`.
