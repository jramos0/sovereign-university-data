term: DLC (DISCREET LOG CONTRACT)

---
Type of smart contract on Bitcoin that enables the execution of contractual conditions based on the outcome of external events, validated by one or more oracles, without these oracles knowing the details of the contract. DLCs were invented by Tadge Dryja in 2018. These smart contracts are primarily useful in financial applications, allowing for the creation of financial instruments or conditional bets, while reducing counterparty risks. To construct a DLC, multiple parties lock bitcoins in a multisig address. These bitcoins can only be unlocked when the oracle publishes the specified information at a given time.
