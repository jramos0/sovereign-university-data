term: METADATA

---
In the general field of computing, this refers to data that provides information about other data. It describes the characteristics, content, quality, format, and structure of the data it accompanies. Thus, a distinction is made between the payload, which represents the core of the information, and the metadata. For example, for a document, metadata can include the author, the creation date, the file size, and associated keywords. In Bitcoin, metadata is found in many elements. It is used in receiving addresses, extended keys, blocks, etc.
