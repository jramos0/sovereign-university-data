A numbering system in base 2, which uses `0` and `1` to represent information. Each digit in this system is called a bit, which is short for "binary digit". In the context of computing, binary is the form of data representation in memory. Computers use binary to process all kinds of information, as it corresponds to the two possible states of an electronic circuit: off or on.
