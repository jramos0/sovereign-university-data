term: BITCOIN FOG

---
Centralized mixing service that operated in the early 2010s. Bitcoin Fog offered users the ability to increase their privacy by pooling their bitcoins into a single transaction, with the aim of dissociating the coins from their transaction history. Given its centralized nature, users had to trust the service operator not to divert the funds and not to keep a record of the mixing operations.
