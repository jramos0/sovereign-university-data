term: HEXADECIMAL

---
A numbering system in base 16, which therefore uses 16 distinct symbols to represent numbers. The first 10 symbols are the digits from 0 to 9, identical to those in the decimal system (base 10), and the following six symbols are represented by the letters A to F. Thus, A represents the number 10, B represents 11, up to F which represents 15. This system is particularly used in computing, as it offers a more concise representation of binary numbers (base 2), and each hexadecimal digit represents exactly 4 bits, simplifying conversions. This numbering system is very often used to represent information about Bitcoin.
