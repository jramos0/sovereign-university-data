term: BIP2

Document authored by Luke Dashjr in June 2012 that establishes specific criteria for the acceptance of future Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). BIP2 introduces the concept of a BIP being "accepted," "rejected," or "withdrawn," and specifies the conditions necessary for each status. A BIP is considered "accepted" if it receives significant support from the Bitcoin community, including developers and users. A BIP is "rejected" when it does not gain enough support or presents insurmountable problems. Finally, a BIP can be "withdrawn" by its author at any time. BIP2 also more precisely redefines the methodology and format introduced with BIP1.
