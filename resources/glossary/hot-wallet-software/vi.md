term: HOT WALLET (SOFTWARE)

---
A hot wallet is a software device dedicated to the security and management of a Bitcoin wallet's private keys. A wallet is considered "hot" when the Bitcoin wallet's recovery phrase is stored on a computing device, through software, that is not solely dedicated to Bitcoin use and is directly connected to the internet. For example, the Samourai Wallet application on your smartphone would be considered a hot wallet.
