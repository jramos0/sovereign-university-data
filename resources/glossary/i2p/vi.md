term: I2P

---
Anonymous communication network designed to ensure the confidentiality of exchanges on the Internet. Like TOR, I2P encrypts network data and uses a routing system called a "mix network". This method guarantees the anonymity of communications by passing them through intermediary servers that redirect the information without knowing the identity of the sender or the recipient. Just like TOR, I2P can be used on a Bitcoin node to secure its network communications.
