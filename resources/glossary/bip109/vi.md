term: BIP109

---
Proposal presented by Gavin Andresen in January 2016 during the Blocksize War. It aimed to increase the maximum block size from 1 MB to 2 MB through a hard fork, while adding certain limits on the number of sigops and sighashs (unlike BIP102). The activation of BIP109 required the support of 75% of the hashing power over a 28-day window. This proposal was an integral part of the Bitcoin Classic fork, which sought to offer a solution for scaling Bitcoin. This proposal was never adopted.
