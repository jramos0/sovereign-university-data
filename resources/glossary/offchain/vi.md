term: OFF-CHAIN

---
Refers to transactions or activities related to Bitcoin that occur outside the main blockchain but have a link or anchor to it. They are not immediately recorded on the blockchain and require additional mechanisms to ensure their security and finality. These operations are often justified by a desire to bypass the technical limitations inherent in Bitcoin, in order to have transactions with quick finality, low fees, increased capacity, or more functionalities.
