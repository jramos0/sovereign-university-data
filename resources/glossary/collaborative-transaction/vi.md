term: COLLABORATIVE TRANSACTION

---
A Bitcoin transaction that involves multiple different entities as inputs to the transaction. It is also a transaction model that can be used in chain analysis. The typical example of a collaborative transaction is the coinjoin, where several users pool equivalent amounts in inputs to retrieve the entire sum (minus transaction fees) in outputs of the same amount, in order to prevent tracing by breaking the history of the coins.
