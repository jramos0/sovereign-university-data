Encrypted communication protocol established on Tor that allows collaboration with other users in the context of a Cahoots transaction. Soroban was developed by the teams at Samourai Wallet, to facilitate the exchange of Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) among users who wish to engage in collaborative transactions (*Stowaway*, *Stonewall*, *StonewallX2*...). This protocol is used in the Samourai Wallet app and the Sparrow Wallet software.
