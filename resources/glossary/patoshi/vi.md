term: PATOSHI

---
Refers to a distinct pattern of nonces and timestamps observed in the blocks mined during the early months of Bitcoin's existence. This pattern is suspected to be attributable to a single entity or individual, most likely Satoshi Nakamoto himself, the inventor of Bitcoin. The term "Patoshi" is a portmanteau combining "pattern" and "Satoshi". Several analyses of the early Bitcoin blocks have revealed patterns in the way nonces and extra-nonces were chosen, and how timestamps were set. These patterns were distinct enough to suggest that a particular miner or group of miners was responsible for a large proportion of the blocks mined during this period, while using a modified client. Sergio Demian Lerner, a computer scientist, is credited with the discovery of this pattern in 2013. Lerner estimated that the Patoshi miner had mined about 1.1 million bitcoins. This has led to widespread speculation about the motivations, identity, and current intentions of the Patoshi miner. Some believe that Patoshi was Satoshi himself, mining bitcoins to support and secure the nascent network. It is important to note that, although the Patoshi pattern is widely accepted as evidence of concentrated early mining activity, there is no definitive confirmation of the identity behind Patoshi or their intentions.
