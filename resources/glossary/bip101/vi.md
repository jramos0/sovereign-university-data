term: BIP101

---
A proposal introduced by Gavin Andresen in 2015 aimed at increasing the maximum block size from 1 MB to 8 MB and to double this limit every two years until reaching just over 8 GB in 2036. This proposal was integrated into the Bitcoin XT implementation in August 2015, which effectively became a fork of Bitcoin, but it was not followed through. Therefore, this proposal was never adopted. Some consider the implementation of BIP101 on Bitcoin XT as the casus belli of the Blocksize War.
