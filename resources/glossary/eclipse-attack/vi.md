term: ECLIPSE (ATTACK)

---
An attack that involves isolating and controlling the communications of a node in a network by creating an artificial environment around it. The goal is to filter or manipulate the information received and sent by this node, thereby cutting it off from its legitimate peers. In the context of Bitcoin, this technique can be used to mislead a node, censor or alter the data it receives or sends, or to carry out double-spending attacks.
