term: DIGITAL SIGNATURE

---
Cryptographic proof that demonstrates the possession of a specific private key, associated with a unique public key, without having to disclose it. In Bitcoin, it is constructed using the private key and the hash of a transaction. It attests to the ownership of the bitcoins in question and allows for the satisfaction of a script that unlocks a UTXO. It is generated through an elliptical curve digital signature algorithm such as ECDSA or the Schnorr protocol.
