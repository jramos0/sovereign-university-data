term: BILATERAL ANCHORING

---
A mechanism that establishes a connection between the main Bitcoin system and a sidechain (or a drivechain), that is, a lateral chain. Bilateral anchoring ensures a fixed value correlation between bitcoins on the main blockchain and the corresponding assets on the sidechain, thus allowing the movement of bitcoins between the two chains. To do this, bitcoins are temporarily locked on the main blockchain, and an equivalent amount of assets is issued on the sidechain. This enables the utilization of specific advantages of the sidechain, such as faster transactions or enhanced privacy features, while maintaining the value of the bitcoins used. When users wish to return to the Bitcoin blockchain, the process is reversed: the assets on the sidechain are destroyed, and the corresponding bitcoins are unlocked. There are many different bilateral anchoring mechanisms that can rely on:


- A single trusted third party;
- A federation of entities;
- The miners of the main chain (drivechain).
