term: KYC (KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER)

---
Regulatory procedure used by some companies operating on Bitcoin to verify the identity of their clients as part of the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing. KYC involves the collection and verification of personal data. In the context of buying bitcoins, KYC poses several risks for the user, including:


- The risk of personal data leakage related to an activity on Bitcoin. Storing information on company servers can lead to leaks, exposing user data to phishing attempts, physical attacks, or identity theft, especially due to their association with the Bitcoin environment;
- Exposure to state surveillance. Purchasing BTC through regulated entities can reveal to the state that the user has owned bitcoin at some point, which could have future consequences in the event of political or economic upheavals;
- Facilitation of on-chain tracing. Completing a KYC creates a direct link between the user's identity and their transactions on the blockchain, allowing for an entry point for chain analysis.
