term: BIP10

The BIP10, proposed by Gavin Andresen in 2011, aimed to introduce the concept of multisignature transactions. The main idea of BIP10 was to standardize the way to condition a payment on multiple signatures (multisig) by introducing a new type of script. This proposal suggested allowing transaction issuers to specify multiple public keys and a condition under which a certain number of these keys would need to sign to validate the transaction. However, BIP10 was withdrawn and never integrated into the protocol. The functionalities it envisioned were addressed by other subsequent BIPs, such as BIP11 and BIP16, which introduced more sophisticated and flexible mechanisms for multisig on Bitcoin.
