term: HWI

---
Acronym for "*Hardware Wallet Interface*". It is a standardized interface that facilitates the integration and interaction between Bitcoin wallet management software and hardware wallets. Specifically, HWI is both a Python library and a command-line tool. It eases the communication between these components by using PSBTs (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions) and possibly Descriptors (output script descriptors). This interface was initially developed for Bitcoin Core, and then, it became a standard used by most wallet software.
