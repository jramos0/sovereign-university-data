term: SEED (CRYPTOGRAPHY)

---
Outside the context of Bitcoin, in the field of cryptography in general, a seed is an initial value used to generate cryptographic keys, or more broadly, any type of data produced by a pseudo-random number generator. This initial value must be random and unpredictable to ensure the security of the cryptographic system. Indeed, the seed introduces entropy into the system, but the generation process that follows is deterministic.
