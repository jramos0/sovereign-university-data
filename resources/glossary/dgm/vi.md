term: DGM

---
Acronym for "*Double Geometric Method*". It is a method for calculating miner compensation within mining pools. DGM is a hybrid method, intended to combine the advantages of PPLNS and the so-called "geometric" method. It features low variance on shares, similar to PPLNS, then allows the miner to absorb variance to reduce that of the pool subsequently. DGM is resistant to pool hopping by ensuring that the expected payment per share remains constant. The method is based on scores, making payments independent of the pool's history and almost entirely independent of future difficulty changes.
