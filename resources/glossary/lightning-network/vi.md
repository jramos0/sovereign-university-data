term: LIGHTNING NETWORK

---
A higher-layer protocol built on top of the Bitcoin protocol, aimed at enabling fast and low-cost transactions. It allows for the creation of payment channels between participants, within which transactions can be made almost instantly and with minimal fees, without having to record each individual transaction on the blockchain. The channels can remain open almost indefinitely, and only require transactions on the blockchain when they are opened and closed. The Lightning Network aims to improve Bitcoin's scalability and to make it feasible for small-value payments.
