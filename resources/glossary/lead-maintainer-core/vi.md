term: LEAD MAINTAINER (CORE)

---
The lead maintainer was a role within the hierarchy of Bitcoin Core. This role no longer exists as of February 2023. This person was responsible for leading the project and thus had more power than the maintainers. The role of lead maintainer was naturally assumed by Satoshi Nakamoto until his departure at the beginning of 2011. Subsequently, Gavin Andresen, who had already contributed alongside Satoshi, took over the leadership of the software until the beginning of 2014. From that date, Wladimir J. van der Laan assumed this role until February 2023. Since then, there has been no lead maintainer for the project.
