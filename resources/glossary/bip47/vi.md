term: BIP47

Proposed by Justus Ranvier in 2015, this protocol aims to solve the critical problem of Bitcoin address reuse, a practice that severely compromises user privacy on the system. Satoshi Nakamoto, in the Bitcoin White Paper, had already highlighted the importance of using distinct key pairs for each transaction to maintain segregation in the different actions of users. BIP47 introduces the concept of reusable payment codes, allowing a user to receive multiple payments without having to manually generate a new Bitcoin address for each transaction. These codes act as virtual identifiers, derived from the user's wallet seed and located at the account level in the derivation structure of an HD wallet. From the combination of the payment codes of both parties, each can derive a large number of unique addresses belonging to the other party, without needing to communicate again with them. The core of this protocol relies on the ECDH algorithm (*Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman*), a variant of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange established on elliptical curves, which allows both parties to establish a shared secret for generating unique receiving addresses. Although BIP47 has not been added to Bitcoin Core and has received a mixed reception from the community, implementations such as PayNym on Samourai Wallet and Sparrow Wallet have adopted it and fully integrated it into their privacy tool ecosystem.
