term: HALVING

---
The term "halving" refers to a scheduled event that cuts in half the reward given to miners for each mined block through the block subsidy. This reduction specifically applies to the portion of the block subsidy consisting of new bitcoins created out of thin air. Halving was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, as a mechanism to control inflation and ensure a limited supply of bitcoins.

The initial block reward was 50 bitcoins, and halving occurs every 210,000 blocks mined, which takes about four years. The halvings have occurred:


- At block 210,000 on November 28, 2012, to reduce the subsidy to 25 BTC;
- At block 420,000 on July 9, 2016, to reduce the subsidy to 12.5 BTC;
- At block 630,000 on May 11, 2020, to reduce the subsidy to 6.25 BTC;
- At block 840,000 on April 20, 2024, to reduce the subsidy to 3.125 BTC.

Halvings will continue to occur until the block reward reaches zero, at which point the maximum supply of about 21 million bitcoins will have been reached. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place around the spring of 2028, although the exact date may vary slightly depending on the block mining time. At that time, the block reward will be reduced from 3.125 to 1.5625 bitcoins. This will be the fifth halving in the history of Bitcoin. As block subsidies decrease, transaction fees become an increasingly important source of revenue for miners, ensuring their motivation to continue participating in the proof of work.
