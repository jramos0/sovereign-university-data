---
Establishes a new standardized process for the classification of Bitcoin improvement proposals. BIPs must now be classified into 4 categories:


- Consensus*: concerns proposals that require a change in consensus and affect compatibility between previous and future versions of the Bitcoin protocol. These are soft forks and hard forks;
- Peer Services*: concerns modifications to services and communication protocols between network nodes, without affecting consensus;
- API/RPC*: encompasses proposals aimed at modifying the APIs and RPCs used to interact with Bitcoin nodes;
- Applications*: includes improvement proposals for applications that run on top of the Bitcoin network, like typically standards related to wallet software.
