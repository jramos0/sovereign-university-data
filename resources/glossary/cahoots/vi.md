term: CAHOOTS

---
Within the framework of the Samourai Wallet portfolio and other wallet software that implements it, a Cahoot refers to all types of transactions carried out in collaboration between multiple users. Thus, to engage in a Cahoot means to participate jointly in a transaction. This collaboration revolves around the exchange of partially signed transactions. These exchanges can be done either manually, via QR codes, or in an automated manner, through the Soroban communication network. Among the cahoots, we find:


- Stowaway transactions (Payjoin);
- Stonewall x2 transactions;
- Joinbot transactions.
