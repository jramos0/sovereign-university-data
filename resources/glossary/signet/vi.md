term: SIGNET

---
Specific versions of the Bitcoin network designed for development and testing. Signets simulate the behavior of the main network (mainnet) but with the ability to control various parameters. They thus provide an environment for testing new features or changes without the risk of disrupting the main network and without incurring fees. Compared to the testnet, signets offer more structured control over block generation, often managed by one or more trusted entities or by a custom consensus mechanism. This allows for the creation of more predictable test scenarios, as opposed to the testnet which is subject to the unpredictability of mining, in the same way as the mainnet.
