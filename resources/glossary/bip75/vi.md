term: BIP75

---
Extension that enhances the BIP70 payment protocol by introducing two major innovations. First, it allows the sender of a payment request to voluntarily sign this request and provide a certificate that enables the recipient to know the identity of their counterpart. Second, it encrypts the returned payment request to prevent any interception and viewing by third parties. This strengthens the security and privacy of transactions by ensuring that payment details are visible only to the participants. BIP75 also offers new features to improve the user experience. Despite these improvements being built on BIP70, they have never been widely adopted.
