term: QR CODE

---
A type of two-dimensional barcode that can be quickly scanned by mobile devices. The QR code stores information in the form of black and white pixels arranged in a square on a white background. An important feature of QR codes is that they incorporate BCH error correction codes, which allow data to be restored even if the QR code is partially obscured.

The QR code is widely used in Bitcoin to facilitate the transmission of information between two devices. It is primarily used to share receiving addresses, encoded in the URI format in accordance with BIP21. However, its use also extends to extended keys, PSBTs, Lightning invoices, etc.
