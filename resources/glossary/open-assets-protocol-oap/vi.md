term: OPEN ASSETS PROTOCOL (OAP)

---
The Open Assets Protocol (OAP), designed by Flavien Charlon in 2013, represents the first functional implementation of Colored Coins. This protocol enabled the storage and transfer of non-native assets on the Bitcoin blockchain in the form of tokens called "Colored Coins". These are specifically marked to symbolize a promise, whether formal or informal, of exchange for real goods or services.
