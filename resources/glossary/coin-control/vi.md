term: COIN CONTROL

---
A feature found in some Bitcoin wallet software that gives users the ability to manually select specific UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) to use as inputs for making a transaction. In other words, coin control offers the possibility to precisely choose which pieces of bitcoins will be spent. This functionality is similar to the action of choosing a specific coin from your wallet to pay for your baguette.

Coin control is particularly useful for managing transaction fees and for enhancing privacy. Indeed, by specifically selecting the UTXOs to consume, users can avoid merging UTXOs from different sources, which could reveal information about their entire funds (CIOH). This feature often comes with the ability to label transaction outputs.
