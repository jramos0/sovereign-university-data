term: BITCOIN GOLD (BTG)

---
Cryptocurrency system created from a hard fork of Bitcoin (BTC), which occurred on October 24, 2017, at block 491,407. The fork was initiated by a group of developers and investors dissatisfied with the direction Bitcoin was taking, particularly regarding the increasing concentration of mining power in the hands of a few large farms using ASICs. Bitcoin Gold aimed to democratize the mining process by using a new proof-of-work algorithm, named Equihash, which is resistant to ASICs and therefore favors mining with graphics cards (GPU). The goal was to make participation in mining accessible to a larger number of people in order to decentralize it and reduce the risks associated with centralization. BTG initially used the same mining algorithm as Zcash (ZEC). They later slightly modified it to create Equihash.
