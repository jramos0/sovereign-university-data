term: FLAG DAY

---
Method of activating a soft fork used in the early years of Bitcoin. This process simply sets a deadline, known as "Flag Day," before which the protocol update must be adopted by the entire network. This approach is straightforward: after this date, nodes and miners must have updated their software to comply with the new rules, otherwise, they risk being on an incompatible chain.

However, this method is very risky nowadays, as it requires significant coordination and consensus within the community, without which the network may experience a split, and the updated chain might not be the longest (with the most work accumulated). The Flag Day method can still be used for non-controversial changes or urgent technical corrections.
