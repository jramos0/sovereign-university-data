term: BLOCKSIGNERS

---
In the context of Liquid (a Bitcoin sidechain), these are the entities responsible for constructing and validating blocks within this chain. Liquid uses a federation model where the blocksigners, selected from the federation members, work together to confirm transactions and create new blocks to form the sidechain's consensus. The role of a blocksigner is one of the official positions in Liquid. They fulfill both this role and that of watchmen (guardian).
