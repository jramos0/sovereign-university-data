Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) refers to the regulatory measures adopted to prevent the use of Bitcoin in illegal activities. These measures include the identification and verification of customer identities (KYC), monitoring transactions to detect "suspicious" patterns, and collaborating with authorities to report activities considered illegal. Regulated exchange platforms are required to comply with these measures to operate in many jurisdictions, including France.
