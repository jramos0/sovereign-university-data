term: CONCATENATION

---
In the context of cryptography and computer systems, refers to the process of assembling two operands by putting them end to end, thus forming a new string of characters or data. This operation is generally denoted with a symbol of two vertical bars $\Vert$, or with the symbol $\circ$. For example, the concatenation of $45$ with $87$ would be equal to $4587$. We denote: $45 \Vert 87 = 4587$. The two operands have been put end to end.
