term: ENCRYPTION (ENCRYPT)

---
Cryptographic method for converting raw information into encrypted information. Encrypted information masks the original meaning of the data to prevent it from being known. Encryption involves a series of transformations performed on the original information using a key. If these transformations are reversible, the corresponding reversal process is called "decryption," and it allows the information to be restored to its raw state.
