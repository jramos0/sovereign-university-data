term: HODL

---
A popular term within the Bitcoin community that refers to the practice of holding onto one's bitcoins for the long term, despite market volatility, and not selling them. The term originated from a typo in [a message posted in 2013 on the Bitcoin Talk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.msg4022997#msg4022997) by the user *GameKyuubi*, who appeared to be intoxicated, in which he wrote "I AM HODLING" instead of "I AM HOLDING," which means "to hold" in English. This word quickly became a meme and a slogan.
