term: BITCOIN POOLED MINING (BPM)

---
Another name given to the "SCORE BASED METHOD" for calculating miners' compensation within mining pools. It's a proportional reward method, but weighted by the time at which the share is submitted. BPM values shares based on the time elapsed since the beginning of the mining cycle. The later a share is submitted in the cycle, the higher its value. This method encourages miners to stay because each time they stop mining, their score stagnates while those of others increase more rapidly.

"Bitcoin Pooled Mining" was also the name of Slush's mining pool in 2011, which originated the similarly named compensation calculation method.
