term: GPL

---
Acronym for "*GNU General Public License*". It is a series of free software licenses originally created by the Free Software Foundation. It guarantees users the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software. However, the GPL requires that any derived or modified software also be distributed under the same license, ensuring that the original freedoms are preserved in all versions of the software. The GPL is often used for open source projects and is sometimes found in projects related to Bitcoin. However, the initial license for Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin client was an MIT X11. This is still the case for Bitcoin Core.
