  The Bitcoin DIlemma is a clear and conscious story of the development of the
  cryptocurrency industry today. Featuring interviews with key players within
  crypto, finance, technology, cybersecurity industries, Khan brings a highly
  sensitive topic to clarity. "Cryptocurrencies have received a bad name over the
  past decade and it's time to bring the real picture to people worldwide. We hope
  this clears a lot of confusion, eliminates the dilemmas behind crypto, and helps
  the common man or woman understand what role crypto is going to play in their
  lives in the future", says Khan.
