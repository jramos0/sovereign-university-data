  God Bless Bitcoin asks the timely question: How do we fix our broken money?
  Through in-depth conversations with bitcoin and interfaith religious leaders,
  the film exposes the broken, unjust, and immoral nature of our current
  fiat-based monetary system, one that is intimately connected to the military
  industrial complex and the propagation of war. The film also shows how and why
  members of the poor and middle class feel a financial squeeze even when they
  work hard and lead fiscally responsible lives. God Bless Bitcoin ultimately
  suggests the ways in which bitcoin can present alternatives to our current
  system that are more just, equitable, and peaceful.
