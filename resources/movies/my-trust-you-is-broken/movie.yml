  Dynamic chronicles of the tumultuous origins of Bitcoin as a payments system and
  the story behind the BTCPay Server â€“ currently the most widely used self-hosted
  payment processing stack for Bitcoin, created by Nicolas Dorier in response to
  BitPay and its actions during the 2017 Blocksize Wars. The film highlights the
  early days of Bitcoin as a tool for merchants, their issues, and the perils of
  trusted third parties, as well as Dorier's pivotal role in contributing to the
  current adoption of Bitcoin payments among businesses.
