  Bond to Unbind is an experimental documentary that explores the relationship
  between the US-Dollar and El Salvador. By creating the Bitcoin Law, this small
  nation has made bold moves and shocked the establishment. El Salvador is the
  first country to confront our financial and political leaders with the
  uncomfortable truth - that there is a new player in the world of public debt
  lending, Bitcoin. Many individuals globally have found Bitcoin as a lifeboat -
  but the government of El Salvador headed by President Nayib Bukele is the first
  to test it on a nation state level by making it legal tender and with the
  issuance of bitcoin backed Volcano Bonds.
