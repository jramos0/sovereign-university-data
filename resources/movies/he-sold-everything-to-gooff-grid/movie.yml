  "You can spend every day worrying about what might happen, or you can get on
  with your life. So I figure if the worst comes to the worst and we are all wrong
  for some reason, I'll just get up tomorrow and carry on with a new plan. That's
  basically it, isn't it?" I hope this story inspires you, dispels some of the
  narratives around bitcoin mining and shows the potential of Bitcoin mining and
  heat transfer.
