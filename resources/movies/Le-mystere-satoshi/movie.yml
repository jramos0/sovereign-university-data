  The Satoshi Mystery deciphers the inner workings of the Bitcoin revolution while
  investigating the identity of its enigmatic creator, who has remained anonymous
  until now. On January 3, 2009, a certain Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin, the
  very first decentralized and reliable cryptocurrency. In 2011, it disappeared
  from circulation.
