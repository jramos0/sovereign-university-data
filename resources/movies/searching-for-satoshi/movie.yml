  On January 3, 2009, a secretive software engineer with the pseudonym "Satoshi
  Nakamoto" launched the world's newest monetary invention: a cryptocurrency
  called bitcoin. Just over two years after bitcoin was introduced, Nakamoto
  vanished, with over one million bitcoin to his name. The mystery inventor's
  worth has reached as high as $70 billion, but not a single one of those bitcoins
  has ever traded hands or moved from Nakamoto's online wallet. After sending a
  few cryptic emails stating he "may not be around," Nakamoto went silent and has
  not been heard from since early 2011. Why did Nakamoto disappear? Some have
  speculated that he may have taken his own life. Or maybe he wanted to wash his
  hands of his bitcoin project, walking away from it all and maintaining his
  anonymity. In this film, director and producer Paul Kemp goes on a worldwide
  journey to piece together the most compelling case yet for who Satoshi Nakamoto
  was and why he disappeared.
