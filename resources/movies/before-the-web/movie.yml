  In the early 1990s, a group of mathematicians, misfits, hackers, and hobbyists
  calling themselves "the cypherpunks" came together around a shared belief that
  the internet would either demolish society's artificial walls or lay the
  groundwork for an Orwellian state. They saw cryptography as a weapon against
  central planning and surveillance in this new virtual world.
