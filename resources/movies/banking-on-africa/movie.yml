  As the world races to lead the way in blockchain technology, could Africa have
  an advantage? This documentary follows the journeys of two African Bitcoin
  pioneers, Alakanani Itireleng (Founder of the Satoshi Centre, Botswana) and
  Lorien Gamaroff (Founder of Usizo). Exploring their hopes for this technology
  and how it could be used to improve the lives of millions of people, experts in
  finance, economics and technology weigh in with a mix of industry research,
  opinions and passion for what the future global economy could hold. And, with
  much of the developed worldâ€™s banking system becoming increasingly unstable,
  this documentary starts a conversation about cryptocurrency and Africa
  leapfrogging problems to live in a better global financial system.
