  Bitcoin: The End Of Money As We Know It traces the history of money from the
  bartering societies of the ancient world to the trading floors of Wall St. The
  documentary exposes the practices of central banks and the dubious financial
  actors who brought the world to its knees in the last crisis. It highlights the
  Government influence on the money creation process and how it causes inflation.
  Moreover, this film explains how most money we use today is created out of thin
  air by banks when they create debt. Epic in scope, this film examines the
  patterns of technological innovation and questions everything you thought you
  knew about money. Is Bitcoin an alternative to national currencies backed by
  debt? Will Bitcoin and cryptocurrency spark a revolution in how we use money
  peer to peer? Is it a gift to criminals? Or is it the next bubble waiting to
  burst? If you trust in your money just as it is - this film has news for you.
