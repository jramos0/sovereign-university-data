  The short film "Bitcoin Is Generational Wealth," produced by Swan Studios,
  delves into Bitcoin's potential to extend humanity's focus on long-term projects
  and achievements. It highlights the recurring historical cycles of societal and
  monetary rise and fall, emphasizing that humanity now has access to an
  unprecedented, incorruptible form of money. Bitcoin offers the possibility of
  preserving and productively reinvesting capital across generations, fostering a
  vision of enduring stability and progress, breaking the cycles of collapse, and
  enabling a lasting and productive peace.
