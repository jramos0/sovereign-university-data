   Node Nation 是一项教育计划，旨在通过比特币向萨尔瓦多公立学校的学生宣传金融主权。该计划以技术为重点，教授学生如何配置和管理比特币和闪电网络节点。
   该项目采用实用的技术方法，旨在通过安装和管理节点，传授有关比特币和去中心化的知识。该项目得到了教育部、国家比特币办公室和 Plan B Network 的支持。
   Node Nation has an ambitious and revolutionary goal: to install 6,000 Bitcoin nodes in public schools across the country, setting an unprecedented milestone in global Bitcoin adoption. This effort not only seeks to position El Salvador as a world leader in financial sovereignty but also to train a new generation of students in the tools needed to participate in the digital revolution of the future. With each node installed, students will not only learn to master this technology but also become the custodians of the decentralized power of Bitcoin.
